# The Goal

Demoing or teaching code is difficult. A PowerShell demo traditionally use the old PowerShell ISE, copy/paste and relying on PSReadLine to highlight syntax, or switching between something like VSCode to show the code and the Windows Terminal to run the code. Manually typing the code live are prone to typos and syntax errors, and a bit of memorization. All of which are fairly time consuming and take time away from teaching.

The libDemo module is designed to be a single file solution to the PowerShell demo conundrum. A single file module simplifies the use and portability of demo files.

libDemo does not fake type commands. I personally see this is a time consuming step that takes time away from teaching. I did add some pretty scroll animations though...
